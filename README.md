Rust wrapper for [libxslt](http://xmlsoft.org/), and a sibling crate to [libxml](https://crates.io/crates/libxml).

The main goal of this project is to benefit from libxslt's maturity and stability while native Rust XSLT crates mature to be near-drop-in replacements.

**Coverage**: This is an infant proof of concept in both coverage and feature richness, **NOT** ready for production use.

**Welcome!** With these caveats, the contributors to the project are migrating production work towards Rust and find a continuing reliance on libxslt a helpful relief for initial ports. As such, contributions to this crate are welcome, if your workflow is not yet fully supported.
